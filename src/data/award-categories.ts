        name: "International Institutional Engagement Award",
        description: "The International Institutional Engagement Award will honour initiatives in the field of election assistance and election observation that successfully contributed to an increase of legitimisation of the electoral process and a growth of public confidence towards democratic procedures.",
        context: "Article 21 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights enshrines the right of everyone to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. Furthermore, Article 21 determines that the will of the people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures. The engagement of International Institutions, Governmental and Non-Governmental Organisations and Charities aims at supporting countries to carry out elections that meet these fundamental democratic principles.",

        name: "Electoral Conflict Management Award",
        description: "This Award will honour undertakings of an Electoral Management Body or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders that have effectively managed a pre- or post-electoral conflict and/or successfully managed elections in a conflict environment.",
        context: "Conflicts and disputes related to elections are multifaceted. Pre- or post electoral disputes are an important proof for the vitality of a political system and for ability to critically asses and question democratic processes. Furthermore, they are a sign of civil society’s common understanding of electoral procedures. Moreover, elections can be used as a mediating and pacifying instrument to solve an existing political conflict in a given country. The acceptance of the outcome of an election is once more a viable sign for the maturity and health of a democracy. Nonetheless, elections can also cause conflicts ranging from peaceful protests to mass upheavals and violent eruptions. A recent development is the transformation from post-conflict elections to conflict elections. More precisely this means that elections are often held in countries with ongoing conflicts, in a hostile and violent environment. It is a common practise of anti-democratic forces to threaten and harm voters on polling day to sabotage elections and undermine a countries democracy.",
        criteria: "Different conflicts need different solutions and approaches to be solved. The Electoral Conflict Management Award will honour undertakings of an Election Management Body or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders that have effectively managed a pre- or post-electoral conflict. Furthermore, the successful use of elections as a pacifying or mediating instrument and the prevention of electoral violence will be rewarded. Additionally, the successful holding of elections in a conflict environment will be recognised.\n\nThe members of the Electoral Stakeholders Network are invited to nominate an Election Management Body or an Election Management Official who has achieved outstanding results in the field of electoral conflict management. Nominations should specify the Election Management Body or Person nominated and the respective initiative. Criteria will include the originality of the initiative, how well it was implemented, and how effective its results have been."

        context: "Ensuring equal access and participation in the electoral process is a fundamental aspect of a democratic society.

        context: "The successful management of elections is crucial to a valid outcome of the democratic process. Truly democratic elections often stand and fall with the quality of the electoral management which has to be done differently in every country. There is no one size fits all approach for successful electoral management. However, election management is mainly about handling the organisation, logistics and infrastructure of elections. Breaking it down, election management is predominantly tackling the challenge of voter registration, guaranteeing a transparent and secure electoral process, carrying out a flawless authentication of voters, providing the necessary facilities, instruments and materials for elections and securing a faultless and adequate counting of the votes and presentation of results.",
        criteria: "The Electoral Management Award recognises electoral management approaches by Electoral Management Bodies or or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders which were able to overcome remarkable country specific challenges; guaranteeing a secure, transparent and smooth running of elections.\n\nThe members of the Electoral Stakeholders Network are warmly invited to nominate an Electoral Management Bodies or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders who delivered an outstanding management of elections, achieving excellent results.

        name: "Citizens' Engagement Award",
        description: "This Award rewards Electoral Management Bodies or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders for putting citizens at the heart of the electoral process and maximising their engagement and their satisfaction. This could comprise initiatives to tackle low turnout, cynicism, distrust, perceived legitimacy issues.",
        context: "Democracy is government by citizens, and elections are the tool which is used across the democratic world to ensure that citizens are in control of their political system. This means that citizens should be at the heart of any election, and that the absolute priority of any election management body should be to ensure that elections are organised in such a way as to optimise the engagement, participation, satisfaction, trust, and perceived legitimacy of citizens.",
        criteria: "The Citizens Engagement Award is aimed at rewarding Electoral Management Bodies or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders for embracing what should perhaps be their most important goal: to put citizens at the heart of the electoral process and maximise their engagement and their satisfaction. At a time when most democratic societies face problems with citizens’ engagement, such as low turnout, cynicism, distrust, perceived legitimacy issues, and low democratic satisfaction, Electoral Management Bodies have a key role to play to restore trust in the electoral system and citizens’ involvement in electoral democracy.\n\nAs a consequence, we invite nominations for any outstanding initiative by an Electoral Management Body or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders to foster and improve citizens engagement. This could be a policy which has improved turnout, is improving citizens’ trust in or satisfaction with the electoral process, or has attempted to better understand what are citizens’ perceptions about the electoral process or what impedes them from being more engaged. Nominations should specify both the Election Management Body and/or person nominated and the initiative perceived to have improved citizens’ engagement.

        context: "Academic research has shown that the most important election in an individual’s life is usually his/her first. First time voters are ‘special’, because how they perceive the first election in which they are eligible to vote, whether they do participate in it or abstain, and how good or bad their first electoral experience is will determine their perception of and attitudes towards electoral democracy for the rest of their lives. First time voters are also unique because of the challenges that they pose to Election Management Bodies. They may not have any prior knowledge about elections, parties, or the electoral process, they may be intimidated by their new responsibility as a citizen, and they may have different questions and concerns as compared to experienced voters.",
        criteria: "The First Time Voters Award will recognise Electoral Management Bodies or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders which have taken outstanding measures to facilitate, optimise, and/or help the electoral experience of first time voters, realising the importance of the first electoral experience of a voter and the unique challenges that it raises.\n\nInitiatives nominated for the award may be directed at any type of first time voters: young voters who reach franchise age for the first time, new citizens, who have just received the nationality of their country and will be eligible to participate in its elections for the first time, or even all citizens in a country that has had its first democratic elections.

        name: "Electoral Ergonomy Award",
        description: "This Award will recognise Electoral Management Bodies or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders which tailored electoral procedures to the psychology of their voter and the specific characteristics of their electorate.",
        context: "Electoral ergonomy is the optimisation of the design of every detail of electoral procedures to make them as suited as possible to the citizens of a given country. Research has shown that every detail in electoral procedures matters. Adapting them to the psychology of citizens and the specificity of a country’s society and culture can have an immense impact on the quality of electoral democracy. Indeed, electoral ergonomy can have a very strong effect on minimising error and influences in the vote, they determine how comfortable voters are with elections, and how positively they feel towards the electoral process.",
        criteria: "The Electoral Ergonomy Award will therefore recognise outstanding initiatives taken by an Election Management Body or Electoral Management Officials, Civil society organisations, (CSO's), non-governmental organisations NGO's, and other stakeholders that tailor some electoral procedures to the psychology of their voter and the specific characteristics of their electorate (cultural habits, demographic and geographical make-up of the population, social or literacy characteristics, etc).\n\nInitiatives nominated for this award may pertain to any aspect of electoral ergonomy, such as the design of the polling ballots or adaptation of voting machines, the organisation of the polling station or the polling booth, research on alternative voting mechanisms such as advanced, postal, or electronic voting.

Nominations should specify both the Election Management Body nominated and the initiative perceived to have improved citizens’ engagement. Criteria will also include the originality of the initiative, how well it was designed and implemented, and how effective its results have been."

        context: "Throughout history it has been proven that the action, dedication and commitment of one individual can have the power to massively impact on social, political and cultural matters. Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther King and Emmeline Plankhurst, are among the most popular examples where the effort of one individual changed, what has been widely perceived as unchangeable. Especially in politics this unconditional personal commitment for a special cause is entangled with personal sacrifice. Mostly because political issues and problems are deeply rooted in society, interests fiercely protected by political or economic elites and thus it takes more than a lifetime to solve them.",

Honoured shall be courage, persistence, dedication and the decision to cope with an issue against all odds.\n\nThe members of the Electoral Award Committee will chose a winner who matches the above described criteria."

However, the responsibilities of the head of an electoral commissioner are very similar, yet highly complex. Longstanding expertise in the field of elections is needed, as well as an in-depth understanding of the political landscape and the civil society of a given country. Moreover, the head of an electoral commission must constantly stay in contact with his fellow commissioners all over the world, to stay informed and learn about new electoral practices but also to share his experiences.\n\nThe ICPS International Electoral Award Committee will honour a selected Commissioner with the Commissioner of the Year Award. A decision will be made by taking into consideration the in-country but also international engagement of the Commissioner. The Award Committee will pay special attention to the Commissioner’s commitment and contribution to strengthen the international electoral community.\n\nThe ICPS Electoral Stakeholders Award Committee will create a shortlist on the basis of the submitted nomination and will subsequently choose a winner.

Their duties are manifold and so are their challenges. Every Electoral Commission depending on the countries electoral system, demographic and geographic constitution has to approach its tasks in a fundamentally different way. Even the organisational composition and structure of Electoral Commissions differs vastly.\n\nThe Award for the Electoral Commission of the year will honour a Commission, taking into consideration the above described diversity of challenges, duties and organisational structures. Furthermore, the effort to foster a 'community of good citizens' among election practitioners and the search for best practice and evidence based research and policy in the field of elections of Electoral Commissions worldwide will be taken into consideration.\n\nThe Electoral Commissioner of the year Award is a non-nomination category.
